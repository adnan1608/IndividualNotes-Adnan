  <h2>Web Technologies</h2>

<h3> Front-end development</h3>

It is also known as client-side development which is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments.


<h3>HTML</h3>
<p> Hypertext Markup Language is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document.
All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes.<br>

<div>The three main parts of an element are:</div>

<li>Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag < p > to create a paragraph.</li>
<li>Content – this is the output that other users see.</li>
<li>Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example,  </ p >  to end a paragraph.</li>
The combination of these three parts will create an HTML element:

<div>The < !DOCTYPE html > declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</div>
The < html > element is the root element of an HTML page<br>
The < head > element contains meta information about the HTML page<br>
The < title > element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)<br>
The < body > element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br>
The < h1 > element defines a large heading<br>
The < p > element defines a paragraph<br>
  Headings Size
  h1
  h2
  h3
  h4
  h5
  h6
  <br>
  For Break line < br ><br>

  Horizontal Rule < hr ><br>

  To center content < center ><br>
  For giving comments in the code < !-- Comment -- ><br>
  For creating an unordered list = < ul ><br>
  For creating an ordered list = < ol ><br>
  To add a italic style < i > is used and < em > is used for italic the word
  with an emphasis.<br>
  <li>Add Image</li>For adding a photo in webpage= < img class= “ ” src= “ ” alt= “ ”>
<li>Add Link</li>
  For add a link on page= < a > which is known as anchor element.
<li>For Creating Table</li>
  For creating we use table < table > element.<br>
  < tr ></ tr> is used for creating a row element.<br>
  < td ></ td> is used for creating table data Cell element.<br>
  < thead ></ thead> is used for creating table head element.<br>
  < tbody ></ tbody> is used for creating table body element.<br>
  < tfoot ></ tfoot> is used for creating table foot element.<br>
  < th ></ th> tag in HTML is used for setting the header cell of a table.
</p>

<h3>CSS </h3>

<p> Cascading Style Sheet is used to set the style in web pages that contain HTML elements. It sets the background color, font-size, font-family, color, … etc property of elements on a web page.
There are three types of CSS which are given below:<br>


Inline CSS<br>
Internal or Embedded CSS<br>
External CSS<br>

<li>Inline CSS: Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with element is known as inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute.</li>

<li> Here are some basic properties of CSS</li>

<div>->align : Specifies the alignment of flexible container's items within the flex container.</div>

<div>->animation : Specifies the keyframe-based animations.</div>

<div>->border : Sets the width, style, and color for all four sides of an element's border.</div>

<div>->color : Specify the color of the text of an element.</div>

<div>->font : Defines a variety of font properties within one declaration.</div>


Example:<br>
< head><br>
< style><br>
  .myDiv {<br>
border: 5px outset Maroon;<br>
background-color: RosyBrown;<br>
  font-style: oblique;<br>
text-align: center;<br>
font-family: Comic Sans MS;<br>
display: block; overflow: auto;<br>
  width: 1000px; max-width: 1000px;<br>
  margin: 0 auto;<br>
}

</ style><br>
</ head><br>

<li>External CSS: External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, … etc). CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. This means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.</li>
</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.

<div>Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.
Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</div>
JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:<br>

<li>Internal JS: We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the < script > tag. The < script > tag can either be placed inside the < head > or the < body > tag according to the requirement. </li>
<li>External JS: We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js and then link this file inside the < head > tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</li>

<li>Some core features of Javascript are:</li>

<div>->Variables : Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var</div>

<div>->Operators : An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</div>

<div>->Conditionals : Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if ... else statement.</div>

<div>->Functions : Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</div>

<div>->Events : Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. </div>

<li>Syntax Example:<br>

  const para = document.querySelector('p');<br>

  para.addEventListener('click', updateName);<br>

  function updateName() {<br>
    let name = prompt('Enter a new name');<br>
    para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;<br>
  }<br>
</li>

</p>
</div>

</body>
